                <p>Thoughtworkers are passionate about technology. We build it, research it, test it,
                    open source it, write about it, and constantly aim to improve it - for everyone. Our mission
                    is to champion software excellence and revolutionize IT. We create and share the Thoughtworks
                    Technology Radar in support of that mission. The Thoughtworks Technology Advisory Board,
                    a group of senior technology leaders in Thoughtworks, creates the radar: They meet regularly
                    to discuss the global technology strategy for Thoughtworks and the technology trends that
                    significantly impact our industry.</p>
                <p>The radar captures the output of the Technology Advisory Board's discussions in a format that provides
                    value to a wide range of stakeholders. from CIOs to developers. The content is intended as a concise summary.
                    We encourage you to explore these technologes for more detail. The radar is graphical in nature, grouping
                    items into techniques, tools, platforms, and languages & frameworks. When radar items could appear in multiple
                    quadrants, we chose the one that seemed most appropriate. We further group these items in four rings to reflect
                    our current position on them.</p>
                <p>We take the same approach to content delivery as we do to many of the technologies we describe in the radar -
                    we like to experiment. This iPad app was created in this spirit. In presenting information in an interactive manner,
                    it changes the nature of the reading experience. and we are keen to understand the ways in which this happens
                    and to continue to improve on it.</p>

                <h3>What's new?</h3>
                <p><b>Here are the trends highlighted In this edition:</b></p>
                <p><b>Mobile</b> - As mobile is rapidly becoming the primary way that people access the intemet, this needs to be factored
                    in to new enterprise application strategy. product strategy and implementation -from 'mobile Hrst" design all the
                    way through to a new breed of testing tools.</p>
                <p><b>Accessible Analytics</b> - Big Data does not have to equal Big Budgets. A combination of open-source tooling and
                    cloud-based infrastructure provides a more readily accessible analytics and visualization approach.</p>
                <p><b>Simple architectures</b> - Simple continues to gain traction, including both techniques for building and composing
                    applications, as well as infrastructure-based techniques to enable simple deployment, failover and recovery. This
                    theme is a recurring one for us, but we have not yet seen the usage shifts we believe are necessary.</p>
                <p><b>Reproducible environments</b> - Tools supporting the standardization, set-up automation and coordinated management
                    of development, test and production environments for both internally hosted and public cloud environments feature
                    prominently on this edition of the radar.</p>
                <p><b>Data persistence done right</b> - As NoSQL databases are maturing and gaining acceptance, an understanding of
                    the patterns for use (and abuse) becomes imperative.</p>
